we propose the framework considering optimal $t$-matchings excluding a prescribed $t$-factors inside bipartite graphs. a proposed framework was the generalization of a nonbipartite matching problem and includes several problems, such as a triangle-free $2$-matching, square-free $2$-matching, even factor, and arborescence problems. inside this paper, we demonstrate the unified understanding of these problems by commonly extending previous important results. we solve our problem under the reasonable assumption, which was sufficiently broad to include a specific problems listed above. we first present the min-max theorem and the combinatorial algorithm considering a unweighted version. we then provide the linear programming formulation with dual integrality and the primal-dual algorithm considering a weighted version. the key ingredient of a proposed algorithm was the technique to shrink forbidden structures, which corresponds to a techniques of shrinking odd cycles, triangles, squares, and directed cycles inside edmonds' blossom algorithm, the triangle-free $2$-matching algorithm, the square-free $2$-matching algorithm, and an arborescence algorithm, respectively.
